#' @details Expected powered product of random variables is expectation of
#' their product given powers \code{expectation_powers}. Therefore in order to approximate
#' expected value of i-th random vector component just set all 
#' \code{expectation_powers} to zero except it's i-th component which should
#' be assigned 1.
