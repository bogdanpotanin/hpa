Description: Multivariate conditional and marginal densities, moments, cumulative distribution functions as well as binary choice and sample selection models based on hermite polynomial approximation which was proposed and described by A. Gallant and D. W. Nychka in 1987 (Gallant and D. W. Nychka. Semi-nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation. Econometrica, 55(2):363-90, 1987. DOI: 10.2307/1913241).
